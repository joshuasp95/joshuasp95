# Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

I'm Joshua Sainz Palacios, an Environmental Science enthusiast who loves exploring the potential of digital technologies. ðŸ˜„

Most of my academic life has been focused within the Scientific-Technological field in the Environmental field. However, upon discovering new digital technologies and seeing their potential, I wanted to combine both disciplines.

Techniques such as Database Manipulation, Statistics, Process Automation, and the Preparation of Cartographic Maps, among others, are the ones to which I devote the most attention and are included within Geoinformatics and Geospatial Analysis.
